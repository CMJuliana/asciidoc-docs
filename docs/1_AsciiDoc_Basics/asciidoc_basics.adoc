== AsciiDoc Basics

This section provides a quick introduction to **AsciiDoc syntax** and the elements most
commonly used in technical documentation.  

It serves as a practical reference for writing clean, structured documents that can be
converted into HTML, PDF, or other formats.

=== Headings

AsciiDoc headings are created using one or more `=` characters at the start of a line:

----
= Document Title

== Section Title

=== Subsection

==== Sub-subsection
----

=== Text Formatting

You can apply basic formatting to emphasize text:

----
*Bold text*

_Italic text_

`Monospace (inline code)`

*_Bold and italic_*
----

=== Lists

Unordered Lists

----
* Item A
* Item B
** Nested item
** Another nested item
----

Ordered Lists

----
. First step
. Second step
. Third step

=== Tables

AsciiDoc supports several ways to create tables.  
Here are the two most common formats: **pipe-style tables** and **tables with column specifications**.

**Pipe-style table**

This is the simplest and most commonly used table format.  
Cells are defined using the `|` character, and the table is enclosed in `|===` markers.

----
|===
| Product | ID        | Status

| Widget A | A001     | Active
| Widget B | B019     | Discontinued
| Widget C | C442     | Pending Review
|===
----

Use this format when you need a quick, readable table without special alignment or column control.

**Tables with Column Specifications**

For more control over layout (such as column width, alignment, or formatting),  
you can specify column definitions using the `cols=""` attribute.

Example:

----
[cols="2,1,2"]
|===
|Product Name |Code |Description

|Widget A
|A001
|General-purpose component used in multiple assemblies.

|Widget B
|B019
|Obsolete item scheduled for removal.

|Widget C
|C442
|Awaiting quality assurance approval before release.

=== Links and Cross-References

Create **cross-references** between pages or sections by defining **anchors** and then
linking to them.

To define an anchor in AsciiDoc, place an ID above a section:

----
[[installation]]
== Installation Guide
----

Call (reference) the section using the following syntax:

----
See <<installation>> for more information.
----

You can also provide custom link text:

----
For details, see <<installation, the installation section>>.
----

To include external hyperlinks, place the URL followed by the link text in square brackets:

----
https://example.com[Example Website]
----

You can also use bare links without custom text:

----
https://example.com
----

=== Images

Images are inserted using the `image::` macro. 

You can specify attributes such as alt text, width, height, or roles inside the brackets.

Example:

----
image::images/example.png[Example image, width=300]
----

=== Code Blocks

Standard AsciiDoc source block:

....
[source,python]
====
def hello():

    print("Hello AsciiDoc")
====
....

(Four dashes define the block; the outer pair wraps the block metadata.)

=== Admonitions

Use admonitions to highlihgt important information and help users identify key points in your documentation:

[Note]
====

This is a general note. Use it to provide context, additional information or clarifictions that support the main content.
====

[Important]
====
This is important information the reader should pay attention to before continuing. It often highlights prerequisites or essential instructions.
====

[Warning]
====
This is a warning. Use it to alert readers about potential issues, data loss, or unsafe actions.
====

Admonition syntax:

----
[Note]
====
Admonition content.
====

[Important]
====
Admonition content.
====

[Tip]
====
You can give your admonition any title you want.
